# Azure VM — Bicep template

Broch on a single Azure VM, deployed with Bicep. **This is the same template Broch, LLC runs for its own production deployment** — what you deploy here is what we run.

The VM runs the canonical [`with-postgres-external` + Caddy compose stack](../../docker-compose/with-postgres-external/) **verbatim** (cloud-init embeds it at deploy time, so the box runs the same bytes as a docker-direct deploy). You choose:

- **Database** — `databaseMode=Existing` (bring your own reachable PostgreSQL 14+ via a connection string), `databaseMode=Managed` (the template provisions a **private** Azure Database for PostgreSQL Flexible Server — VNet-injected, no public endpoint), or `databaseMode=Local` (PostgreSQL runs **on the VM** on a small dedicated data disk — zero DB prerequisites, but **you manage backups**; see [Local database](#local-database)).
- **TLS** — `certMode=Auto` (Caddy issues + auto-renews the apex + wildcard via ACME DNS-01; `dnsProvider=Cloudflare` with an API token, or `AzureDns` with the VM's managed identity — **no secret**) or `certMode=Byo` (supply your own wildcard cert + key).

**Bring your own domain.**

For the click-to-evaluate path with no VM to manage, see the [ACA Bicep](../azure-container-apps/) instead.

  The VM is disposable: broch + caddy from the canonical with-postgres-external
  compose, started by systemd. Application state lives in the external DB; a small
  dedicated data disk persists Caddy's TLS cert store (and the Local-mode database)
  across recreation. SSH is closed by default — manage via `az vm run-command` /
  Azure Serial Console.
```

- An Ubuntu 24.04 VM (default x86 `Standard_B2s`; ARM64 is a one-line opt-in via the `vmSize`/`imageSku` params where Ampere capacity exists).
- A **static** Standard public IP — the address your DNS points at.
- An NSG: HTTP (80) + HTTPS/HTTP-3 (443 tcp+udp) from the internet. SSH (22) is **closed by default**; set `sshAllowedCidr` to a CIDR for break-glass SSH.
- A small **dedicated data disk** (`dataDiskSizeGb`, default 4 GiB Standard SSD) attached in **every** database mode. It backs `/var/lib/docker/volumes`, so Caddy's TLS certificate/ACME store survives VM recreation — a recreate re-uses the issued certificate instead of re-requesting it from Let's Encrypt (see [TLS](#tls--certificate--dns)) — and in `databaseMode=Local` it also holds the PostgreSQL data.
- cloud-init that drops in the canonical compose + Caddyfile + Caddy.Dockerfile, writes the **non-secret** `.env`, **fetches the secrets (master key, DB credential, IdP secret, DNS-01 tokens) from Key Vault at boot** (see [Secrets & break-glass](#secrets--break-glass)), mounts the data disk at `/var/lib/docker/volumes`, installs Docker, and starts the stack via systemd. With `databaseMode=Local` it also runs Postgres on that disk (see [Local database](#local-database)).

Telemetry, logging, and the license are configured **in-app** (Admin → …) after first sign-in — not in the deploy.

## Sizing

At **idle** (Local mode), the three containers total **~700 MB** resident — Caddy ~68 MB, broch/.NET ~205 MB, Postgres ~25–60 MB; the rest is the OS. cloud-init also provisions a **2 GB swapfile** for headroom on small/burstable sizes.

| `vmSize` | vCPU / RAM | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Standard_B1ms` | 1 / 2 GiB | **Floor** — comfortable at idle (~1.2 GiB free, swap untouched). The single vCPU is the limiter under concurrency. |
| `Standard_B2s` | 2 / 4 GiB | **Recommended default** — the 2nd vCPU noticeably speeds boot convergence (ACME issuance, .NET JIT). |

> **The real workload is SSH tunnels.** Broch's load is long-lived tunnel connections, so the operative cost is `~700 MB baseline + (concurrent tunnels × per-tunnel cost)`. Per-tunnel cost is **small** — on the order of **1–2 MB RAM and a small fraction of a vCPU per concurrent tunnel** at idle, scaling modestly with relayed throughput. At these sizes the **single vCPU is the binding constraint** (connection count + keepalive), not RAM — memory has comfortable headroom on `B1ms` and the swapfile is a further cushion. `B1ms` is the **floor** and `B2s` the recommended **default**; do not size below `B1ms` for a production deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Azure CLI logged in (`az login`), Contributor on the target resource group. **Owner or User Access Administrator** is needed only if you let the template auto-grant the Azure-DNS role (below) or set `adminObjectId` — both create role assignments.
- A database — **one of**: an existing **PostgreSQL 14+** reachable from the VM with a least-privilege role that owns its own database (`databaseMode=Existing`; see [Database setup](#database-setup)); let the template provision one (`databaseMode=Managed` — you set `postgresAdminPassword`); or run it **on the VM** with nothing to pre-arrange (`databaseMode=Local` — you manage backups; see [Local database](#local-database)).
- For `certMode=Auto`, DNS for your wildcard hostname on a supported provider: **Cloudflare** (API token, Zone:Read + DNS:Edit) **or** **Azure DNS** (no secret — uses the VM's managed identity). With Azure DNS, set `dnsZoneResourceGroup` and the template **grants the identity *DNS Zone Contributor* on that resource group automatically** (needs Owner/UAA there); if you only have Contributor, leave it empty and grant the role by hand. For `certMode=Byo`, a wildcard cert + key — no DNS provider needed.
- An identity provider app (Auth0, Entra ID / Azure AD, Okta, or any OIDC) — Broch has no built-in local login, so the IdP is configured at boot. Register the callback `https://<shareSubdomain>.<dnsZone>/auth/callback`. See the [identity-provider guides](https://broch.io/docs/identity-providers/).
- **A master key** — generate with `openssl rand -base64 48` and store it in your own secret store. **Required** (≥32 chars); supply the same value on every (re)deploy. Broch never sees it. For an existing Broch database it must be that database's key.
- **No SSH key to prepare** — SSH is closed by default and the VM gets a generated break-glass password (`adminSshPublicKey` is an optional advanced override; the password lands in a Key Vault — see [Secrets & break-glass](#secrets--break-glass)).
- A Broch license — activated in-app after first sign-in (Admin → License). Buy at [broch.io/pricing](https://broch.io/pricing).

## Database setup

*Only for `databaseMode=Existing`. `Managed` (provisions a private Flex Server) and `Local` (runs Postgres on the VM — see [Local database](#local-database)) need no pre-setup — skip this section.*

The VM connects as a least-privilege role that owns **only its own database** — never the server admin (which would expose every database on the server). As the server admin, from a host allowed through the DB firewall:

```sql
-- connected to the default 'postgres' database:
CREATE ROLE broch LOGIN PASSWORD '<generated>';
ALTER DATABASE brochdb OWNER TO broch;

-- then connected to 'brochdb' — REQUIRED on PG15+: the database owner does NOT
-- automatically get CREATE on the public schema, so migrations otherwise fail with
-- "42501: permission denied for schema public":
ALTER SCHEMA public OWNER TO broch;
```

After the VM deploys, add its public IP (a deployment output) to the database server's firewall.

## Local database

`databaseMode=Local` runs PostgreSQL **on the VM** (the bundled [`with-postgres`](../../docker-compose/with-postgres/) compose) — **nothing to set up first**. The template generates the Postgres password, and the database lives on the **dedicated data disk** the template attaches in every mode (`dataDiskSizeGb`, default **4 GiB** Standard SSD — Broch's database is tiny; size up only if you retain large audit/request-log history). cloud-init mounts that disk at `/var/lib/docker/volumes`, so the database **survives reboots and VM recreation** — the disk is a *separate* resource, so a from-scratch reprovision (or `az vm delete` + redeploy) reattaches it with data intact. The generated Postgres password is **derived** (from the resource group + VM name), so it stays the same across a recreate and still matches the surviving database. You can override it with **`localDbAdminPassword`** (re-supply the same value on every redeploy). The password value is stored in **Key Vault** (see [Secrets & break-glass](#secrets--break-glass)) and fetched at boot — it is **not** in `customData`, so a plain subscription **Reader** can't read it (that needs *Key Vault Secrets User*). The one residual note: the *derived default* is computable from the (public) resource names, so set an explicit `localDbAdminPassword` if you don't want it formula-derivable. Either way Postgres has **no host port** — the blast radius is in-container code execution, not the network.

> **If you script recreation/reprovisioning of a Local-mode VM,** that automation must (a) **not delete** the `<vmName>-data` disk and (b) re-pass `databaseMode=Local` — otherwise the new VM boots in the default mode with the disk attached but the database on it **ignored** (a deploy that "succeeds" but runs against the wrong/empty database). The disk itself is safe either way: it is declared in **every** database mode, so a redeploy in a different mode — even with `--mode Complete` — keeps it attached rather than deleting or detaching it. The hazard is running against the wrong database, not losing the disk. Broch's own `reprovision-{dev,prod}-vm.yml` workflows use `Existing` mode and are **not** Local-aware.

**Sizing.** Choose `dataDiskSizeGb` at first deploy. Increasing it on a later redeploy resizes the Azure disk but does **not** auto-grow the ext4 filesystem — after the redeploy, run `sudo resize2fs /dev/disk/azure/scsi1/lun0` on the VM to use the new space (and note some disk tiers require a VM deallocate to resize). Shrinking is not supported.

**Zero-downtime (blue-green) upgrades aren't available in Local mode.** A blue-green swap stands up a replacement VM and cuts traffic to it while the old one still serves — which needs an **external, shared** database both VMs reach at once. Local keeps the database on a disk attached to a single VM, so there is nothing to share. A Local upgrade is therefore the recreate-and-reattach described above (the same `<vmName>-data` disk reattaches to the new VM), with a brief outage while it boots. Choose `Existing` or `Managed` if you need zero-downtime deploys.

**Backups are yours.** Local has **no automated backups or point-in-time restore** — choose `Managed` or `Existing` if you need those. Back the Local database up yourself.

**Azure disk snapshot** (simplest) — snapshot the `<vmName>-data` disk on a schedule:

```sh
az snapshot create -g <rg> -n broch-data-$(date +%Y%m%d) \
  --source "$(az disk show -g <rg> -n <vmName>-data --query id -o tsv)"
```

**Logical dump** — `pg_dump` from the VM (no SSH needed):

```sh
az vm run-command invoke -g <rg> -n <vmName> --command-id RunShellScript --scripts \
  'docker exec broch-postgres-1 pg_dump -U broch brochdb | gzip > /opt/broch/backup-$(date +%F).sql.gz'
```

## Setup

```sh
# 1. Authenticate
az login
az account set --subscription <subscription-id>

# 2. Resource group
az group create --name broch-rg --location eastus

# 3. Fill in parameters
cp main.example.bicepparam main.bicepparam
$EDITOR main.bicepparam   # gitignored — non-secret values; pass secrets on the CLI below

# 4. Deploy (secrets via --parameters, never committed)
# brochMasterKey is REQUIRED — generate with `openssl rand -base64 48`, store it, and pass the
# SAME value on every (re)deploy. For an existing DB, use that database's key. No SSH key needed.
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group broch-rg \
  --template-file main.bicep \
  --parameters main.bicepparam \
  --parameters \
      brochMasterKey='<openssl-rand-base64-48>' \
      databaseConnectionString='Host=broch.postgres.database.azure.com;Database=brochdb;Username=broch;Password=<pw>;SSL Mode=Require' \
      cloudflareApiToken='<token>' \
      authClientSecret='<secret>'

# 5. Read the public IP
az deployment group show -g broch-rg -n main \
  --query properties.outputs.publicIpAddress.value -o tsv
```

> **The master key is yours to keep.** `brochMasterKey` is the at-rest encryption root — Broch, LLC never sees it. It is **required**: generate it with `openssl rand -base64 48`, store it in your own secret store, and supply the **same** value on every (re)deploy (the template requires ≥32 chars; the server rejects values under 32 bytes at boot). For an **Existing** database it must be that database's key — a different key cannot decrypt its Data Protection keyring (recoverable: users re-auth and the license re-activates, but disruptive). Rotating it invalidates anything DataProtection-wrapped in the database (refresh tokens, persisted license, usage blob).

## TLS — certificate & DNS

You give the domain as two parts — `dnsZone` (a zone you own, e.g. `example.com`) and `shareSubdomain` (the label that hosts tunnels, default `broch`) — and Broch composes the public host `<shareSubdomain>.<dnsZone>` (e.g. `broch.example.com`), serving that apex and `*.<shareSubdomain>.<dnsZone>`. Capturing them separately means the tunnel host is **always within the zone** by construction. Set `shareSubdomain=''` to serve at the zone apex (`example.com` and `*.example.com`). Broch needs a **wildcard** cert covering both; `certMode` / `dnsProvider` decide how Caddy gets it:

**`certMode=Auto` — Let's Encrypt, auto-renewing.** Caddy issues + renews the apex + wildcard via ACME DNS-01 (the only ACME challenge that issues wildcards), minting the cert against the DNS provider's API *before* any DNS points at the VM — so you validate first, cut DNS over last.

All provider modules are compiled into the broch-caddy image, so the choice is pure config:

- `dnsProvider=AzureDns` — Azure DNS via the VM's **managed identity** (no secret). Set `dnsZoneResourceGroup`; the template **grants the identity *DNS Zone Contributor* on that resource group automatically** (no manual step). The role assignment needs the deployer to have **Owner / User Access Administrator** on the zone's RG; with only Contributor, use `AzureDnsServicePrincipal` instead, or leave `dnsZoneResourceGroup` empty and grant the identity (`managedIdentityPrincipalId` is a deployment output) the role by hand. RBAC propagation is eventual — Caddy retries until it lands. The grant is **RG-scoped** (Caddy's Azure module resolves the zone from the hostname, so it can't be zone-scoped) — if that RG holds multiple DNS zones, consider putting the Broch zone in its own resource group so the VM gets contributor on only the one zone.
- `dnsProvider=AzureDnsServicePrincipal` — Azure DNS via a **service principal** you supply (`azureTenantId` + `azureClientId` + `azureClientSecret`), pre-granted DNS Zone Contributor on the zone. No deploy-time role assignment, so **Contributor is enough to deploy**. Also set `dnsZoneResourceGroup`.
- `dnsProvider=Cloudflare` — set `cloudflareApiToken` (Zone:Read + DNS:Edit).
- `dnsProvider=Route53` — set `awsAccessKeyId` + `awsSecretAccessKey` (Route 53 list+change rights on the zone).
- `dnsProvider=GoogleCloudDns` — set `gcpProject` + `gcpCredentialsJson` (base64 service-account key, roles/dns.admin).
- `dnsProvider=DigitalOcean` — set `doAuthToken` (DNS write scope).

**The issued certificate survives VM recreation — in every mode.** Caddy's cert/ACME store (the `caddy_data` volume) lives on the dedicated data disk, which is a separate resource that a VM delete + redeploy reattaches. A recreated VM therefore re-uses the already-issued certificate instead of re-requesting it — which matters because Let's Encrypt's production rate limits allow only ~5 duplicate certificates per week; repeated recreates without this persistence would lock TLS issuance out for up to a week.

**`certMode=Byo` — your own cert.** Supply `tlsCertificate` + `tlsCertificateKey` (base64 PEM covering apex + wildcard). No ACME / DNS-01 — but **renewal is yours** (replace the files, then recreate Caddy).

Watch issuance:

```sh
az vm run-command invoke -g broch-rg -n <vmName> --command-id RunShellScript \
  --scripts 'cd /opt/broch && docker compose logs --tail 50 caddy'
```

**DNS records — automatic by default.** With `dnsAutoRecords=Auto` (the default) the appliance
**creates and maintains the apex + wildcard A records for you**, pointing them at the VM's public IP
via the same `dnsProvider` credential Caddy uses for the cert — so a deploy goes straight to sign-in,
no records to create, and a changed IP self-heals. It manages `<shareSubdomain>` + `*.<shareSubdomain>`
(or the apex `@` + `*` when `shareSubdomain=''`) inside the **DNS zone that owns the host**. Normally
that is `dnsZone`; the records are written there and the labels are the host relative to it. On Cloudflare the records are created
**DNS-only / grey-cloud** (proxying can't carry tunnel traffic). The records live in **your** zone, so
they **outlive teardown** — delete them by hand if you tear the VM down.

**Delegated (subdomain) zones — `dnsZoneName`.** Auto-DNS writes into the zone that actually **owns**
the host. Normally that is `dnsZone`, so leave `dnsZoneName` **empty** (default) — behaviour is
unchanged. But if your DNS is a **delegated subdomain** — the host lives in its own zone that is a
subdomain of `dnsZone` (e.g. `dnsZone=example.com` for the URLs, but `share.example.com` is delegated
as its own zone) — set **`dnsZoneName`** to that zone. The appliance then writes the records there and
derives the labels as the host relative to it. This is the same zone Caddy resolves for the cert, so a
valid cert can no longer coexist with A-record writes that 404. A `dnsZoneName` that is neither the host
nor a parent of it is **rejected** (auto-DNS is skipped and logged; DNS stays manual) rather than
writing a broken record. The Azure Marketplace wizard fills this from the DNS zone you pick.

Set **`dnsAutoRecords=Manual`** when something sits **in front of** the VM (a load balancer, reverse
proxy, or corporate NAT/egress) — its IP, not the VM's, is what clients must resolve — or when you
manage DNS out-of-band. `certMode=Byo` forces Manual (no DNS credential). In Manual mode, point DNS at
the public IP yourself, **DNS-only / grey-cloud**:

```text
A   broch.example.com    → <public-ip>
A   *.broch.example.com  → <public-ip>
```

Sign in at `https://<shareSubdomain>.<dnsZone>` (e.g. `https://broch.example.com`) — the first user holding an `AUTHENTICATION__ADMINROLES` role becomes admin.

## Secrets & break-glass

**Key Vault (app secrets).** The deployment **always** creates a Key Vault (**access-policy mode**, name in the `keyVaultName` output) holding the deploy-time **app** secrets, which the VM's **user-assigned managed identity** reads at boot (a `get`-only access policy) and writes into `/opt/broch/.env` — so the secret **values never enter the VM's `customData`** (which a subscription Reader can decode):

- `broch-master-key` — the at-rest encryption root (customer-supplied; never generated). It is still born in your tenant and never transits Broch — Key Vault is just where the VM reads it from at boot.
- `db-connection-string` (Existing/Managed) **or** `postgres-password` (Local) — the database credential
- `auth-client-secret` — the IdP client secret (when set)
- `cloudflare-api-token` / `azure-dns-client-secret` / `aws-access-key-id` / `aws-secret-access-key` / `do-auth-token` — Caddy's DNS-01 credential (only the one your provider needs)

The deployment writes these via the control plane and grants the VM identity read via a vault **access policy** — both covered by **Contributor** on the resource group, so the **whole secrets path deploys as a plain Contributor** (no Owner / User Access Administrator). The one exception is `dnsProvider=AzureDns` managed-identity mode, which still creates a DNS-Zone-Contributor *role assignment* (needs Owner/UAA on the zone RG); every other path is Contributor-only. Access policies also take effect immediately — no AAD-RBAC replication lag — so the boot-fetch isn't racing grant propagation (its retry loop stays as belt-and-suspenders). To read the secrets yourself, add an access policy (or *Key Vault Secrets User*) for your principal on this vault.

> **Tradeoff of access-policy mode:** adding access policies is itself a Contributor-level action, so anyone with **Contributor on this resource group** can grant themselves secret-read and read the app secrets. This is **not a new exposure** — a Contributor already has VM-level access (`az vm run-command` → `cat /opt/broch/.env`), so the vault is not a boundary against RG Contributors either way. The win over `customData` is against a subscription **Reader** (who could base64-decode `customData` but cannot read the vault), plus the break-glass password staying in the RBAC vault below that a Contributor **cannot** self-grant. Restrict resource-group Contributor membership accordingly.

**Break-glass password — a SECOND, isolated vault.** When no SSH key is supplied, the generated `vm-admin-password` is stored in its **own** Key Vault (name in the `breakGlassKeyVaultName` output, `<vmName>-bg-<id>`) that the **VM identity has no access to** — so a compromise of broch can't use the VM identity to read the host break-glass password. Set `adminObjectId` at deploy time and the template grants *you* read on **just that one secret** (or grant yourself *Key Vault Secrets User* on that vault manually). **Upgrading an earlier deployment:** this version uses **distinct** vault names — the app-secrets vault is `<vmName>-app-<id>` (`keyVaultName` output, access-policy mode) and the break-glass password moves to `<vmName>-bg-<id>` (`breakGlassKeyVaultName`, RBAC). The earlier template's single `<vmName>-kv-<hash>` vault (which held `vm-admin-password` in RBAC mode) is **left orphaned on purpose**: re-using that exact name would force an RBAC→access-policy permission-model flip on the existing vault, which needs Owner/UAA — so the app vault takes a fresh name to stay **Contributor-deployable**. Update any runbook that read `vm-admin-password` via `keyVaultName`, and delete the orphaned `<vmName>-kv-<hash>` vault by hand once the new deploy is confirmed healthy. (Deployed **with** an SSH key originally? The old template created no vault, so nothing is orphaned — you simply get the two new vaults.)

> ⚠️ **The break-glass password rotates on every redeploy.** `vmPasswordSeed` defaults to a fresh value each `az deployment group create`, so the `vm-admin-password` secret is overwritten on every run — even a routine redeploy to bump `brochVersion` or change a DNS provider. Any out-of-band copy of the old password stops working; re-read it from the break-glass vault after each deploy. To keep a stable password across redeploys, pass an explicit `vmPasswordSeed` (and store it yourself). Note the vault copy tracks the **latest deployment**, while an existing VM keeps its original password (Azure ignores `adminPassword` changes on a re-PUT) — after a retry over a live VM, reset with `az vm user update` if Serial Console is ever needed.

**VM access.** Inbound SSH is closed by default. The box is managed via `az vm run-command` (Azure RBAC — no SSH) and **Azure Serial Console** (sign in as `broch` with the `vm-admin-password` from the break-glass vault above). Supply `adminSshPublicKey` only if you specifically want key-based SSH (then also open `sshAllowedCidr`).

**Runtime config.** `/opt/broch/.env` (mode `0600`) holds the config the compose reads. cloud-init writes the **non-secret** keys (hostname, provider names, IdP client id, etc.) from the deploy parameters; at boot the VM's identity **fetches the secrets from Key Vault and appends them** to the same file:

- `BROCH_MASTER_KEY` → broch's at-rest encryption root
- `BROCH_DB_CONNECTION_STRING` → `ConnectionStrings__BrochConnection` (mapped in compose)
- `AUTHENTICATION__CLIENTSECRET` → the IdP client secret
- `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` → Caddy's DNS-01 credential (Cloudflare mode)
- `AZURE_DNS_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` / `AZURE_DNS_RESOURCE_GROUP` / `AZURE_DNS_TENANT_ID` / `AZURE_DNS_CLIENT_ID` → Caddy's DNS-01 config for **Azure DNS** (cert issuance only — *not* the `AUTHENTICATION__*` IdP sign-in config; managed-identity mode uses only subscription + resource group; service-principal mode adds `AZURE_DNS_CLIENT_SECRET`, fetched from Key Vault)

Rotate a secret by updating it in **Key Vault** and reprovisioning the VM (the boot-fetch re-reads it), or edit `/opt/broch/.env` directly and run `docker compose up -d` (a **recreate** — `env_file` is only read at container create time, so a plain `docker restart` silently keeps the old values).

> **If the first-boot secret fetch fails** (e.g. the VM's managed-identity token isn't yet mintable via IMDS within the ~10-minute retry window, or the vault is unreachable — the app vault's access policy is immediate, so it is not a grant-propagation race), cloud-init aborts before enabling `broch.service`, so broch won't start — and because the fetch runs only on first boot, a plain reboot won't fix it. **Recover by redeploying**: the deploy is idempotent — the data disk and the Key Vault secrets are preserved, and the boot-fetch replaces rather than duplicates `.env` entries — so it simply completes the fetch and enables the service. (If you'd rather not redeploy, re-run the boot scripts on the host and inspect their output: `az vm run-command invoke -g <rg> -n <vmName> --command-id RunShellScript --scripts 'cloud-init single --name runcmd'` — broch starts only if the fetch succeeds, since the start gate still requires the completion sentinel.)
>
> **Still in `customData`:** the non-secret config, and — for now — the BYO TLS cert + key (`certMode=Byo`), the GCP service-account JSON (GoogleCloudDns), and the private-registry token (`registryPassword`; this one is also substituted into a runcmd, so it additionally appears in the VM's boot-diagnostics serial log, readable by VM Contributor — only relevant for private pre-release/beta image pulls, since it's empty for the public image). Moving those file/registry secrets to Key Vault too is a follow-up; the high-value secrets (master key, DB credential, IdP secret, DNS-01 tokens) are already Key Vault-only and absent from `customData`.

## Retrying a failed deployment

A deployment that fails partway (quota, capacity, a permissions error on the DNS role assignment) leaves the already-created resources in the resource group. **Do not start over in a new resource group.** Fix the cause (e.g. request the quota increase the error links), then retry the **same deployment into the same resource group**:

- **Portal — Azure's Redeploy button on the failed deployment (the intended path).** The form comes back with every **non-secret** parameter prefilled from the failed attempt. **Re-enter the master key — that is the whole retry.** Every other vault-backed secret may be left blank: blank never overwrites, the boot-fetch list derives from your selections, and the values the failed attempt stored in the Key Vault are reused (the Managed admin password included — the pg module reads it back via `getSecret()`). `brochMasterKey` is ARM-required, so an accidental empty submission is rejected at validation, before anything deploys.
- **CLI** — the same `az deployment group create`; only `brochMasterKey` must be re-supplied.
- If the attempt being retried was a **recovery deployment** (`softDeletedVaultNames` populated — see [Key Vault soft-delete under Teardown](#teardown)), the prefilled names are safe to leave as-is: the recover pre-pass is a no-op over the now-live vaults.

Every resource re-PUTs idempotently, including the VM: the boot-fetch list baked into its `customData` derives from the **selections** (database mode, cert mode, DNS provider, auth provider), not from which params were supplied, so a retry produces byte-identical `customData` no matter which secret fields were filled — which matters because Azure **rejects** a `customData` change on an existing VM (`PropertyChangeNotAllowed`).

Rules of the retry:

- **Same non-secret selections** (region, modes, provider, names) as the failed attempt — the retry resumes that deployment; it is not a chance to change shape. The prefilled form gives you this for free.
- **The master key must be the SAME value** as the failed attempt (stored-key contract). Supplying a value in any other secret field **overwrites** the stored one — that is how you deliberately rotate a secret on a retry.
- The blank-reuse contract holds only for secrets the failed attempt actually **stored**. If the failure hit the Key Vault itself (nothing stored), re-enter the values; a blank whose secret was never stored fails **closed** — the boot-fetch halts on the missing vault secret and `broch.service` is never enabled (a Managed retry fails even earlier and louder: `getSecret` on the missing admin password is an ARM deployment error). Complete a boot-fetch brick by redeploying with the missing value and re-running the fetch (`az vm run-command ... 'cloud-init single --name runcmd'`), or delete the VM and redeploy.
- The customData-delivered inputs are the exception to blank-reuse: **BYO cert/key and the GCP service-account JSON** are not in the vault. On a retry over an existing VM they are simply ignored (the VM keeps its files); if the failure predated the VM, re-supply them or the box comes up without them (fails at cert issuance/serving).
- Corollary: `authProvider` set with **no client secret** (secretless/public-client OIDC) fails closed at the boot-fetch — unsupported via this template.
- The break-glass `vm-admin-password` rotates on every run (see the warning above); on a retry over an existing VM the vault copy diverges from the VM's real password — reset with `az vm user update -g <rg> -n <vmName> -u broch -p <new>` if Serial Console is ever needed there.

The Azure Marketplace wizard is deliberately **first-deployments-only** (conditional required/visible fields, which the raw form cannot do); the Redeploy button is the one retry surface.

## Recovering an existing installation

Recovering a broken or dead box (VM corrupted, region incident, accidental delete) is a **redeploy of the prior deployment — not a fresh deploy**. The state that matters is the database; the VM is stateless and rebuildable. The one hazard is the **version**: Broch runs EF migrations on boot, so a redeploy at a *newer* version than the database silently migrates it **irreversibly** — recovery must come back at the version you were running, and upgrades stay a separate, deliberate step.

The recovery path preserves the version for free:

- **Azure portal** — resource group → **Deployments** → select the prior successful deployment → **Redeploy**. Every non-secret parameter — `brochVersion` included — comes back prefilled; re-enter the master key (same value) as in [Retrying a failed deployment](#retrying-a-failed-deployment).
- **CLI** — re-run `az deployment group create` with your original parameter file.

**Do not recover through a fresh marketplace wizard run.** The listing republishes with each Broch release, so a fresh wizard defaults `brochVersion` to the *latest* release — newer than your database if you have not upgraded since. If the wizard is your only option, overwrite the version default with the version you were running.

Where to find the version you were running:

- **Box dead**: resource group → **Deployments** → the prior deployment → **Inputs** shows `brochVersion`.
- **Box alive**: Admin → System shows the server version, or read `BROCH_VERSION` from `/opt/broch/.env` via `az vm run-command`.

## Pulling a new Broch image

The documented upgrade is the same in-place flow for everyone — edit one line + recreate:

```sh
az vm run-command invoke -g broch-rg -n <vmName> --command-id RunShellScript --scripts '
  cd /opt/broch
  sed -i "s|^BROCH_VERSION=.*|BROCH_VERSION=1.27.0|" .env
  docker compose pull broch && docker compose up -d broch'
```

Caddy keeps serving across the broch restart. Broch runs EF migrations on boot, so when sharing a database across instances, keep their versions matched and roll one at a time.

**Private / pre-release images.** The image defaults to the public `ghcr.io/broch-io/broch` — a normal deploy needs nothing. To run a private pre-release/beta image you've been granted, set `brochImage` and `registryPassword` (the `registryServer`/`registryUsername` default to GHCR, so the token is usually all you supply); the template logs in on the VM before pulling.

## Taking over an existing database

Pointing this VM at a database another Broch instance already uses is a **migration, not a test**:

- **One instance per database.** Broch does not cluster — don't run two instances against the same DB at once. Stop the other first.
- **Version match.** A different image version migrates the schema on boot; pin `brochVersion` to the version the other instance runs.
- **Master key must match** — a fresh key cannot decrypt stored state.
- **Back up** the database + master key, and validate against a restored copy first.

## Teardown

In **Existing/Managed** mode the database is separate, so the box is disposable (back up the DB + master key, not the VM) — the `<vmName>-data` disk holds only the TLS certificate store, which is re-issuable, so deleting it costs at most a fresh ACME issuance on the next deploy (avoid churning it repeatedly — see the rate-limit note under [TLS](#tls--certificate--dns)). **In `databaseMode=Local`, that same `<vmName>-data` disk holds your entire database** — a separate resource that deliberately survives VM deletion, so teardown must treat it as the thing to preserve (and the disk-cleanup step below deliberately excludes it).

If you deployed into a **dedicated resource group** and have **no Local database to keep** — Existing/Managed mode, or you have already snapshotted/moved the `<vmName>-data` disk out of the group — teardown is one line:

```sh
az group delete --name <dedicated-rg> --yes
```

> ⚠️ **In `databaseMode=Local`, `az group delete` DESTROYS your database.** It removes *every* resource in the group, **including the `<vmName>-data` disk** — `deleteOption: Detach` only protects the disk when the *VM* is deleted via the VM API, **not** when the enclosing group is deleted. To keep a Local database, do **not** use `az group delete`: first snapshot or move the `<vmName>-data` disk out of the group (see [Local database](#local-database)), or delete resources individually with the `-data`-excluding filter below.

**If the VM shares a resource group with your database** (or anything else you want to keep), do **not** delete the group — it takes the DB with it. Delete only this deployment's resources (default `vmName` is `broch`):

```sh
RG=broch-rg VM=broch
az vm delete         -g $RG -n $VM --yes
az network nic delete        -g $RG -n $VM-nic
az network public-ip delete  -g $RG -n $VM-pip
az network vnet delete       -g $RG -n $VM-vnet
az network nsg delete        -g $RG -n $VM-nsg
# az vm delete leaves the OS disk — remove it too. The `!ends_with(...,'-data')` filter EXCLUDES the
# dedicated data disk so a teardown never silently destroys your Local-mode database (starts_with(
# 'broch-data', 'broch') would otherwise match it). Delete it explicitly only when you truly want it
# gone — in Existing/Managed it holds only the re-issuable TLS cert store, in Local your DATABASE:
#   az disk delete -g $RG -n $VM-data --yes
# Build the query in a variable with `!` SINGLE-quoted: in an interactive shell (history-expansion on by
# default) a double-quoted `!ends_with` is taken as a history event -> `bash: !ends_with: event not found`
# and the filter never runs. Single quotes around the `!` segment suppress that; $VM still expands.
Q='[?starts_with(name, '"'$VM'"') && !ends_with(name, '"'-data'"')].id'
az disk list -g $RG --query "$Q" -o tsv | xargs -r az disk delete --yes --ids
```

> **Key Vault soft-delete.** The deployment creates a Key Vault for the app secrets (`<vmName>-app-<id>`), **plus a second one for the break-glass password** (`<vmName>-bg-<id>`) in no-SSH-key mode — both deterministic (the `keyVaultName` / `breakGlassKeyVaultName` outputs). (Upgrading from the old single-vault template? Its `<vmName>-kv-<hash>` vault is left orphaned — delete it separately; see [Secrets & break-glass](#secrets--break-glass).) After a teardown that removes a vault, it stays **soft-deleted for 7 days**, and a fresh deployment into a recreated **same-name, same-region** resource group derives the same vault names and would otherwise fail with *"A vault with the same name already exists in deleted state"*. To handle this, pass the exact soft-deleted vault name(s) in **`softDeletedVaultNames`**: the deployment recovers each vault whose name it is about to reuse, then proceeds (you supply exactly the same fields either way; supplied values overwrite the recovered secrets). The **marketplace wizard fills this automatically** from a live probe of the subscription's soft-deleted vaults matching this group + region; **raw-form / Redeploy** deployers read the exact name from the error and list it. Recovery is matched on the **exact name**, which makes it robust to template-version drift: a ghost left by an **older template version** (different salt/scheme) simply is not matched — it expires on its own while this deployment creates a fresh, differently-named vault, never a hard failure. The same exact-name match makes an **auth-mode switch safe**: recreating an old SSH-key deployment in password mode finds no break-glass ghost of the new name, so it just creates one fresh (no loud failure). Recreating the group in a **different region** likewise derives fresh names — nothing to recover, leave `softDeletedVaultNames` empty. The recover pass is idempotent — over a live vault of the same name it is a no-op — so a Redeploy retry that carries the names over is safe. Why the pre-pass exists at all: Azure silently auto-recovers a soft-deleted vault on a plain PUT **only when the request matches the vault's state at deletion** — the break-glass vault (RBAC, constant properties) usually passes, but the app vault's access policy names the PREVIOUS deployment's VM identity, and every deployment mints a fresh one, so it can never match without an explicit `createMode: recover` pre-pass. Purge protection is deliberately **off** so the names stay reclaimable (`az keyvault purge` remains available if you ever need a name freed early).
